# Project name
Freshday

# Description
An app for planning the day through lists. The idea was to apply properties of bullet journals and create an alternative to the traditional calendar view.
At this point, issues related to ux design were prioritized.

# Installation
$ git clone OSOITE
$ cd freshday
$ npm start freshday

# Usage
Make todo-lists of the main projects, smaller tasks, meal plans and shoppings so that you don't need to keep those in mind all the time.
It is quite enjoyable to get things done, isn't it? Just klick the line when the task is ready!
